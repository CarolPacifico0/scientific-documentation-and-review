\## Objective Ensure data quality and consistency prior to downstream
statistical analysis.

\## Dataset Overview - Experimental measurements from biological
assays - Mixed data types (numeric, categorical)

\## Quality Control Steps - Detection of missing values - Identification
of outliers - Consistency checks across variables

\## Decisions Taken - Removal of samples with excessive missing data -
Standardization of categorical labels - Flagging, not removing, extreme
but plausible values

\## Rationale Preserving biological variability while removing technical
noise.

\## Outputs - Cleaned dataset - QC report summarizing detected issues
